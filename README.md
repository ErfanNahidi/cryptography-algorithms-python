# Cryptography Algorithms in Python

This project includes a collection of encryption and decryption algorithms in Python that you can use to understand and implement various encryption techniques.

## Implemented Algorithms

In this project, the following algorithms are fully implemented:

- **Caesar Cipher**: A simple and classic algorithm for encrypting letters with shifting.

- **Vigen√®re Cipher**: A more complex algorithm than Caesar that uses a key to shift letters.
- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: One of the most widely used and secure algorithms in the world of encryption.
- **RSA**: Public key encryption algorithm.
- **XOR Encryption**: Simple encryption algorithm using the XOR operator.
- **Shift Cipher**: Similar to Caesar Cipher, with some differences in the way it is shifted.

## Features

- Simple and understandable implementation of each algorithm.
- Text encryption and decryption capabilities.
- Support for text and file data encryption.
- Various algorithms for learning and testing various encryptions.
